# Neural Networks Implementation
>Kushant Patel, MAsc. Mechatronics at Uwaterloo, Ontario, Canada

This repo covers some of my research work pursued at University of Waterloo (2019-2021)

## Topics Covered

**CNNS** - Some of the lessons using Fast Ai , Pytorch, Tensorflow implementations for various imagenet Architectures

**RNNS(LSTMS)** - Recurrent Neural Nets

**Computer Vision Works** - PYimage search by Adrian Implementations

**Important Research Papers** - Covering machine learning(Supervised and Reinforcement Learning)

**Generic concepts in Machine Learning**

**Robotics and Self Driving Car Implementations**

**Excercises from Deep Learning. Ai specialization assignments **

## Usage

Much of the implementations are still WIP (will update soon)
